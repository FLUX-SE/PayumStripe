## Payum Stripe gateways

This library is design to add gateways to Payum to support Stripe checkout session (with SCA support)
and Stripe JS using Stripe JS Elements.

Apart from the gateways you can use this library to make calls to the Stripe API directly
using `Request` classes : [(All|Create|Delete|Retrieve|Update)*.php](./src/Request/Api/Resource)
which are using the related actions : [(All|Create|Delete|Retrieve|Update)*Action.php](./src/Action/Api/Resource).
You can also build your own `Request/Action` classes to fit your need.

> If you are using Symfony, use the bundle : [flux-se/payum-stripe-bundle](https://github.com/FLUX-SE/PayumStripeBundle)

> If you are using Sylius, use the plugin : [flux-se/sylius-payum-stripe-plugin](https://github.com/FLUX-SE/SyliusPayumStripePlugin)
